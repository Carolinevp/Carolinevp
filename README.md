## Hi there 👋, I'm Caroline :woman_technologist:

I'm a full-stack developer from France, currently living in London. 

I work with JavaScript/TypeScript, and gathered most experience in React and React Native in the front-end, and Node, Express and MongoDb in the back-end.

In a former life, I was product manager for luxury brands where I developed a strong  attention to detail, and a love for sleek design (which I tend to apply in my code!).

Outside of programming I love cooking 🌱 and travelling 🌎. I am also a certified yoga teacher 🧘🏽‍♀️ and a bookworm! 🤓
